          <p class="about-me">My name is Stanley Perrin, a 23 year old<br> aspiring
          Fullstack Developer from London. <br> Welcome to my portfolio, which I
          have<br> coded in Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I <br>am an avid football fan
          who supports the <br>Royals (Reading FC). Growing in West London,<br> I have
          also played youth football for Hanwell <br>Town FC. But my love for  technology
          is <br>unmatched and my favourite progamming <br>language has to be JavaScript
          and I am <br>currently learning React. I also enjoy <br>watching movies and TV
          Shows, with my <br>favourites being Breaking Bad and Goodfellas!</p>

            <h2>Flickswipe</h2>
            <p>
              Flickswipe is a mobile app that enables users to quickly
              decide what to watch, using a swipe like process, similar to that
              of tinder. I used Ruby on Rails to develop this app, and created
              the user content controller which, presented the different TV
              shows and movies to the user, using an API. I also created other
              features such as a search bar to search for other users, a modal
              using javascript to get information on different content. I
              also helped on the Front-end side, using HTML and CSS to develop
              the design of the app.

            <p>
              Boatee is an AirBnB clone, in which the user can book and rent out
              boats to other users. With Boatee, I helped create the bookings
              feature, being able to book, edit, and to cancel a booking. I
              also, implemented a rating feature, with a 5-star. like type
              process. This app was also created using rails.

          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p class="profile">
            Born and raised in West London Ealing, I grew up in a big family
            of 8. From a young age, I was always fascinated by technology, and
            I started editing videos by the time I started secondary school.
            Using applications such as Adobe After Effects, Sony Vegas and
            Cinema 3D, and so I have always had a passion for creating things,
            design and more importantly the world of technology and the
            internet. It wasnâ€™t until the pandemic where I began to learn Web
            Development, I began with Python and MySQL, but quickly moved onto
            Ruby on Rails when I began the 6 month bootcamp at Le Wagon. My goal
            is to become a fullstack developer, however, I feel I prefer the
            frontend side of web development as I gravitate more towards design
            and UX/UI development. I do also enjoy the backend side too, as it
            is more technical and problem solving based, which greatly appeals
            to me. Combining both of these two and building a fully functioning
            web app gives me a great sense of achievement and therefore would
            love to work more closely in this field of work. I have not worked
            yet in the field of web development, but I do have experience
            working with the relevant tools and applications that developers
            work with. I also have experience working closely with customers
            and clients, for example, working as a bar manager has taught me
            how to deal with customers first-hand and therefore I have a great
            sense of customer service and knowing what to do to please
            customers, and I think this is very important for a developer as
            frontend developers requires a high degree of this.
